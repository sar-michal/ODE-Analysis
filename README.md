The subject of this report is the planar three-body problem, a classical problem in celestial 
mechanics that involves predicting the motion of three bodies moving under their mutual 
gravitational attraction in a two-dimensional plane. This system is governed by a set of nonlinear 
second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The report consists of solving these ODEs 
using various numerical methods, exploring specific solutions under certain conditions, and 
analyzing the performance of these methods.
